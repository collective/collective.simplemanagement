Simple Management
=================

SimpleManagement, an agile project management tool built on top of `Plone`__ that aims at merging `eXtreme Management` and `SCRUM` approaches. It's based on `Dexterity`__.

Some features
-------------

    - automatic creation of documentation folder
    - POI tracker and project form
    - iterations where you can load/move/work on stories in agile mood ala ScrumDo
    - planning view to move/clone stories between different iterations in agile mood
    - user dashboard where stories and ticket relevant to the user show up
    - booking on the stories (no need to create tasks as mandatory in XM, too often a level/layer too far for our needs)

For a wider view on what this is about take a look at `Maurizio's blogpost`__ and `watch the video`__.


Installation
------------

Please, refer to `official documentation`__.
